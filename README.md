# FRONT RECETTE SOCIAL - BON APPÉTIT TEAM

## Context of our project

In this project we had to create a single page application to connect with the API developed in a previous team work. It has been done following our clients' graphics design to give the best user's experience on both, mobile and desktop.

This is Bon Appétit, the best social web app for those who enjoy cooking and eating.
